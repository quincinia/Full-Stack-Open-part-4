# Full-Stack-Open-part-4
Submissions for FSO part 4

Exercises are divided by their parts (a, b, c, and d), with their own respective branches

I will try to update each readme with notes on each of the exercises

## Exercise 4.1
Changed the connection string from `mongodb://localhost/bloglist` to `process.env.MONGODB_URI`; I don't have MongoDB set up locally.

## Exercise 4.2
Added the `toJSON` formatter to the model. Established an import order (external dependencies -> custom modules -> init app)

## Exercise 4.3
Set up eslint in this exercise.

## Exercise 4.4
`likes` property should be a Number, and not a String.

## Exercise 4.5
Uses the same test cases as 4.4.

## Exercise 4.6


## Exercise 4.7
